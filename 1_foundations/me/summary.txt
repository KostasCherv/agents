I’m a Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience delivering scalable APIs, distributed systems, and data-driven services. With a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Machine Learning, I bring a strong foundation in software engineering, data modeling, and problem-solving.

My core expertise lies in Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Python. I’ve worked across fintech, Web3, and SaaS environments—leading backend initiatives, building reliable infrastructure, and supporting complex data flows. I care deeply about clean architecture, performance, and building systems that scale securely and sustainably.

I’m passionate about working on meaningful products in the areas of financial infrastructure, decentralized systems, and data engineering. I’m particularly interested in roles where I can combine backend engineering with system design and cross-team collaboration.

🔍 Open to remote or hybrid roles in backend-focused engineering teams—especially within fintech, blockchain, or infrastructure-driven companies.
